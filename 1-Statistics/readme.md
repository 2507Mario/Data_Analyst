<h2>Statistics</h2>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<p>You will be introduced to several statistical study methods and learn the positives and negatives of each. </p>

<h3>Lesson 2 : Visualizing Data</h3>

<p>You will learn how to take your data and display it to the world. You will learn to create and interpret histograms, bar charts, and frequency plots.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3 : Central Tendency</h3>

<p>In this lesson you will learn to compute and interpret the 3 measures of center for distributions: the mean, median, and mode.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4 : Variability</h3>

<p>You will learn how to quantify the spread of data using the range and standard deviation. You will also learn how to identify outliers in data sets using the concept of the interquartile range. </p>

<h3>Lesson 5 : Standardizing</h3>

<p>You will learn how to convert distributions into the standard normal distribution using the Z-score. You will also learn how to compute proportions using standardized distributions. </p>

<h3>Lesson 6 : Normal Distribution</h3>

<p>You will learn how to use normalized distributions to compute probabilities. You will also learn how to use the Z-table to look up the proportions of observations above, below, or in between values.  </p>

<h3>Lesson 7 : Sampling Distributions</h3>

<p>You will learn how to apply the concepts of probability and normalization to sample data sets.</p>

<h3>Lesson 8: Estimation</h3>

<p>You will learn how to estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence intervals and estimating the effect of a treatment.</p>

<h3>Lesson 9: Hypothesis Testing</h3>

<p>You will learn how to use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter.</p>

<h3>Lesson 10,11: t-tests</h3>

<p>You will learn how to test the effect of a treatment or compare the difference in means for two groups when we have small sample sizes.</p>
